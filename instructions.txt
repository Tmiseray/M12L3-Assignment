Implementing a Singly Linked List in Python

Objective: 
    - The aim of this assignment is to reinforce understanding of the singly linked list data structure and its implementation in Python.

Problem Statement: 
    - You are tasked with implementing a singly linked list class in Python. The class should support basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Task 1:
    - Implement the Node class to represent individual nodes in the linked list.

Task 2:
    - Implement the SinglyLinkedList class with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Task 3:
    - Test the implemented functionality by performing various operations on the linked list.

Expected Outcomes:
    - Students should be able to implement a singly linked list in Python.
    - Students should understand the basic operations of insertion, deletion, and traversal in a linked list.
    - Students should be able to test the implemented functionality and verify its correctness.
    
    
    
Implementing a Doubly Linked List in Python

Objective: 
    - The aim of this assignment is to introduce students to the doubly linked list data structure and its implementation in Python.

Problem Statement: 
    - You are tasked with implementing a doubly linked list class in Python. The class should support operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Task 1:
    - Implement the **Node** class to represent individual nodes in the doubly linked list.

Task 2:
    - Implement the **DoublyLinkedList** class with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Task 3:
    - Test the implemented functionality by performing various operations on the doubly linked list.
    - We can also implement Doubly Linked Lists. You can read the following resource to learn more about it.
        - Resource: Medium Doubly Linked List

Expected Outcomes:
    - Students should be able to implement a doubly linked list in Python.
    - Students should understand the differences between singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
    - Students should be able to test the implemented functionality and verify its correctness.
